# MusicBlog
This is a small page right now focusing on using a grid system and then flex when resizing to different screens. But I hope to grow it by adding more pages, enabling the viewer to sample music, and like or dislike the music.

What I use on this page:
- HTML
- CSS
  > Display: Grid
  > Grid area
