                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I was been asked recently what my favorite songs are, so I decided to make a list of my top ten songs. 
                    After I show you the list you might say ‘What? Why did she choose these?’. Keep reading the article 
                    because I will explain why these 10 songs are my personal favorites. So with all that said, here are my top ten songs.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-2">
                <h2>#10 "Lightning" by The Afters</h2>
                <p>Once you hear this song you will be immediately in love with the catchy words and the fun music. What really 
                    makes this song is the repetitive bridge that is so full of life you can’t help but sing along.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-3">
                <h2>#9 "It's A Good Day" by FFH</h2>
                <p>This song reminds you that even if it’s a bad day because of “circumstances or situations” it’s still a good 
                    day because “Jesus is Lord and I am saved”. Through Christ there is joy during the trials of life.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-4">
                <h2>#8 "Worn" by Tenth Avenue North</h2>
                <p>This song shows the heart of laying everything in the Lord’s hands. It is a song of surrender and praise to God 
                    that He can mend our worn and torn lives. It also reiterates our hope of running the race till the finish, knowing 
                    we will make it home one day.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-5">
                <h2>#7 "The Battle Belongs To The Lord" by Petra</h2>
                <p>This song has a great message that our victory is found in the Lord; through His power and strength He is victorious. 
                    For me, it has always helped focus my eyes on Jesus.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-6">
                <h2>#6 "A Pilgrims Progress (Keep Runnin')" by Matt Papa</h2>
                <p>This song cries out the goal and the longing of the heart to “keep running” when it is so tempting to stop. 
                    To keep running means to keep on my weary traveler. To keep going until the race is finished, and to see Jesus 
                    with His arms open ready to say “Well done My good and faithful servant.” (Matt. 25:21)</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-7">
                <h2>#5 "The Night Will Soon Be Over" by Dalton & Anna Thomas</h2>
                <p>Based off of the verse Revelation 22:5 “The night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the 
                    Lord God will be their light and they will reign forever and ever.” This song is just beautiful and brings me to 
                    tears of expectant joy because of the hope I have in Christ. It sings of the end times when Jesus will loose the 
                    seals of judgment on the world and how everything will be completed after so long of waiting in the night. The 
                    light will be seen by all and everything that was hidden will be made known (Luke 8:17, 12:2). This is a hopeful 
                    song meant for the times of persecution and tribulation to remind us of our hope in Christ and remind us that the 
                    night will indeed soon be over. The dawn is coming, He will return.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-8">
                <h2>#4 "Alive and Well" by Cindy Morgan</h2>
                <p>The build up to “He is alive” is so powerful and always brings tears because it is about the resurrection of Jesus 
                    from the dead. He has defeated death once and for all that we might have life in Him (Romans 6:9-11). </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-9">
                <h2>#3 "Got To Tell Somebody" by Don Francisco</h2>
                <p>Now we have made it to the most exhilarating of all songs. This song not only has unique music, but also great 
                    emotion from the miracle of the little girl Jesus healed in Matt. 5:21-43. Once the little girl is healed the 
                    dad goes and tells everyone he possibly can. It is unique in the way it tells the story and expresses the 
                    excitement and desire to tell what Jesus has done for you.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-10">
                <h2>#2 "He is Alive" by Don Francisco</h2>
                <p>Another exhilarating song with the excitement of Jesus being alive and forgiving our sins. This tells the story 
                    of Peter who denied knowing Jesus before His death, going from deep remorse to utter joy because Jesus was alive 
                    and had forgiven him.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-11">
                <h2>#1 "Elijah" by Rich Mullins</h2>
                <p>This makes my #1 because it holds my longing to be with Christ, and the desire to leave this sinful flesh and 
                    all the trouble of this world behind. It pictures perfectly how this life is not where my heart lies but that 
                    it lies with Christ.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section s-12">
                <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
                <p>So there is my top ten. These were chosen because they show the Christian faith and hope. These 9 skilled artists 
                    not only are talented in their musical abilities, but also are able to tell a story, to worship, and to uplift the 
                    lowest of hearts to set their eyes on Jesus because He concord all.</p>
